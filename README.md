- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomi Astikainen (@AstikainenTomi). My web3name is w3n:tomi (https://w3n.id/tomi).
- 👀 I am a kickstarter, connector and storyteller.
- 📫 You can reach me by email: astikainentomi(at)gmail.com or on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomiastikainen/).
- 🌱 In Web3, I have been active on Cardano Project Catalyst (https://projectcatalyst.io/) and Polkadot OpenGov (https://www.opengov.watch/).
- 💞️ My special interest is co-creation and implementation of collaborative strategy for decentralized organizations. To help OpenGov be more structured and strategic, I propose a framework called Polkadot GPS. It stands for a "Global Participation Solution" that helps position the available resources (people, tech, money) on strategically important focus areas: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pndvgdac3_cPdy6-YaExUKF-Dz3-6oUg29XwOqmB-iQ/edit?usp=sharing
